### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**giperuzzo/giperuzzo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m not currently working.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Information Technology at Faculdade Univesp, also a FrontEnd course at Senai / Ford and BackEnd at Alura / Oracle to pursue a new professional career.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with the team I intend to be part of, since learning in the area of â€‹â€‹technology changes daily, and also count on the collaboration of other people with more experience.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with referrals and an internship in the development area to put what I'm learning into practice on a daily basis.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my goals and challenges and I'll be happy to share this new trajectory of mine.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? The surest way to connect with me is through my linkedin profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/gisleneperuzzo or WhatsApp 55 11 992638856.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She.
- âš¡ My main expectation with courses in the area of â€‹â€‹Technology is to enter a market that is so promising that, according to research, there is a deficit of professionals and very attractive remuneration, thus being able to reconcile personal and professional life.
